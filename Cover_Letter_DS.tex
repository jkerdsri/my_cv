I have a background in the military where I started my career as an Airforce pilot. However, I got scholarships to study master's degree in computer science in the USA  and geographic information technology in Australia. Finally, I got my Ph.D. in Information and Engineering specialized in virtualization networks.

For a decade, I have worked as a researcher in the data communication laboratory at the Defense Technology Institute under the Ministry of Defense. My main researches relate to big data and machine (deep) learning especially on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for defense technologies. Simultaneously, I was an invited lecturer on information technology at VATEL, Silpakorn University for five years.

In my recent job as a deputy director of data analytics, I have a responsibility to lead a core-data scientist team to make use of micro/granular data and alternative data (Big Data) to augment insights found from aggregated data through the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, text processing, and network theory.

Through over twenty years of my research and development experience, I have a deep understanding of technology trends in detail since I was responsible to lead a basic research group in diverse engineering programs.

Recently, I have granted an Australian permanent resident through Global Talent Visa (subclass 858) program. As a result, I have migrated to work in Australia where currently I'm working at the Parliament of Victoria as a data engineer.

I look forward to hearing from you and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
