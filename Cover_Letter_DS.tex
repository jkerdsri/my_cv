Currently, I am a deputy director of Data Analytics at Bank of Thailand. I just got granted an Australian permanent resident from Global Talent Visa (subclass 858). As a result, I am planning to find opportunity with challenging job in Australia where I was an alumni from University of Melbourne back in 2008. 

I have started my career as an airforce pilot. However, I got a scholarship to study computer science in US for a master degree and master of geographic information technolgy in Australia. Finally, I got my Ph.D. in Information and Engineering specialized in virtualization network.

For a decade, I worked as a researcher in data communication laboratory at defense technology institute under the ministry of defense. My main researches relate to machine (deep) learning especially on convolution neural network (CNN) for defense technologies. Simultaneously, I was an invited lecturer on information technology at VATEL, Silpakorn University for five years.

At present, I have a responsibility to lead a core-data scientist team to make use of micro/granular data and alternative data (Big Data) to augment insights found from aggregated data through the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, text processing, and network theory.

Through over twenty years of my research and development experience, I have a deep understanding of technology trends in detail since I was responsible to lead a basic research group in diverse engineering programs.
I look forward to hearing from you and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
